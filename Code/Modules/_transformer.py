    explains:
        Perform the same MLP on every position. So only one MLP is enough.

    explains:
        After multiple linear projections of Q K V, assemble the scaled-dot-prod attention pools of these projections,
        and a final linear project is followed.
        In detail:
            1. H linear projections on Q K V whom projected to num_hiddens // h dimensions, which stands for H heads
            2. For every head's result, perform scaled-dot-prod attention pool
            3. Assemble H attenion-poolings' output, to have a result with num_hiddens dimensions. A final num_hiddens to 
               num_hiddens linear project is followed
